#TotallyJS

Totallyjs is a lightweight, dynamic, frontend MVC framework designed for interacting with RESTful web interfaces. Totally allows a developer to define all parts of their application only using the javascript language. Templates can be defined using the Totally template engine, which allows for fast front-end view rendering. The Totally template engine lets a developer define a view using simple and intuitive object definitions. In addition to the Totally template engine, the TotallyJS framework provides a standard way of defining controllers, and a simple way to define models so that they are automatically syncronized with an application's back-end. 


## Installation

via bower:

```bash
$ bower install totallyjs
```

## Notes

As of now, totallyjs is only available as an AMD. So to use totallyjs, you'll need to use an AMD loader library like requirejs.
